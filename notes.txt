problems at the current phase: 
user has to be generic, 
currently all methods are created inside user
if some new class(Blog) needs be created, all methods have to be implemented all again.

fix: 
1. composition aproach 
create class Model, declare instance of Model inside User
then delegate Model methods, and create User's own methods.

2. create getters inside to use properties of Model
cons: 
all methods need tto be reimplemented

else allow access to Model props directly from User(user.model.set())
con: 
some instances will require nested calls user.model.set()
some will require direct call user.fullname();l confusing!

COMPOSITION APPROACH FAILS HERE

2. inheritance approach: 
inherit class Model,
then all Model props will be available inside User
